# Bioprinter Nozzle CFD Study – Supplementary Repository

This repository contains all supplementary files associated with the paper:

**Date:** *---*

##  Archival Datasets (Zenodo)

Some simulation packages are too large to host reliably on GitHub (complete ANSYS Workbench projects contain `.wbpj` plus large `_files` directories). For long-term preservation and citation, complete project archives for the 4-outlet nozzle cases are hosted on **Zenodo**.

**Zenodo records:**
- **4-outlet Y-split nozzle**  
  Zenodo DOI: `10.5281/zenodo.XXXXXXX` *(replace with DOI)*

- **4-outlet 90° split nozzle**  
  Zenodo DOI: `10.5281/zenodo.XXXXXXX` *(replace with DOI)*

Each Zenodo record contains the full `.wbpj` project, the corresponding `*_files` directory, exported FLUENT mesh files, and solution data exactly as used in the study.

## Contents

**CAD**
- STEP_files/: STEP models of nozzle geometries.
- STL_Files/: STL models of nozzle geometries.

**Meshes**
- mesh_files/: Exported ANSYS FLUENT mesh files (.msh) corresponding to the geometries used in the CFD simulations.

**Simulation metrics**
- data/: CSV exports of per-outlet metrics (velocity, pressure, wall shear stress), organized by nozzle configuration and inlet pressure.

**Figure generation**
- Plotting_Scripts/: LaTeX/TikZ/PGFPlots sources used to generate manuscript figures.
- figure_source/ and introductory_figure/: High-resolution PDFs of manuscript figures.

**Workbench automation and reproducibility**
- workbench_journals/: ANSYS Workbench journal files documenting the meshing and setup workflow.
- WorkbenchArchives/: placeholder directory to indicate where full Workbench project archives belong; complete 4-outlet archives are hosted on Zenodo.

## Usage

1. **Reproduce figures:**  
   - Compile the `.tex` files in `Plot_TeX/` (requires `tikz` and `pgfplots`).  
   - The output matches the PDFs in `Figures/`.  

2. **View CAD models:**  
   - Open files from `CAD/` in Fusion 360, SolidWorks, or any STEP/STL-compatible viewer.  

3. **Inspect meshes**
   - Load .msh files in mesh_files/ directly in ANSYS Fluent to inspect grid topology, boundary naming, mesh quality, and size.

4. **Recreate meshes/simulations:**  
   - Load journals from `Workbench_Journals/` in ANSYS Workbench to reproduce meshing and CFD setup.

## Notes

- Rheology parameters (K, n, μ) and solver settings are summarized in **Table 2 of the paper**.  
- Density values are literature-informed assumptions; bounds for K and n are discussed in the sensitivity analysis.  
- Files are provided as used in the study to the extent permitted by size constraints and standard sharing practice.
